abstract: The problem of information overloading is prevalent in recommendations
  websites and social networks. Users seek relevant recommendations from
  like-minded connections. User-item interactions (i.e., ratings) are prevalent
  in recommendation websites such as Netflix, whereas user-user connections are
  the interaction sought in social websites such as Twitter. Social recommender
  systems seek to generate recommendations for users based on similar
  preferences of their close friends. Because social networks do not normally
  contain user-item interactions, social recommender systems are typically
  hybridized with other recommenders (e.g., website recommenders such as
  Netflix) that provide such interaction. However, current systems are unaware
  of the userâ€™s additional contextual information when coupled with social
  counterparts. In this paper, we propose a context-aware deep learning-based
  recommender system, US-NCF, in support for social recommender systems. Our
  experiments show US-NCF outperforms state-of-art counterparts.
