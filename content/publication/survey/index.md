abstract: The high abundance of IoT devices have caused an unprecedented
  accumulation of avalanches of geo-referenced IoT spatial data that if could be
  analysed correctly would unleash important information. This can feed decision
  support systems for better decision making and strategic planning regarding
  important aspects of our lives that depend heavily on location-based services.
  Several spatial data management systems for IoT data in Cloud has recently
  gained momentum. However, the literature is still missing a comprehensive
  survey that conceptualize a convenient framework that classify those
  frameworks under appropriate categories. In this survey paper, we focus on the
  management of big geospatial data that are generated by IoT data sources. We
  also define a conceptual framework and match the works of the recent
  literature with it. We then identify future research frontiers in the field
  depending on the surveyed works.
