abstract: Current cloud deployments heavily depend on hypervisor-based
  virtualizations. The overarching characteristics of Docker and
  containerization have given them a momentum in their widespread adoption
  recently as alternatives for their counterparts. However, little research has
  been done for comparing the QoS of both technologies, thus leaving the domain
  without widely accepted performance metrics. Aiming at informing the decision
  of the best fit in a specific cloud deployment, we have designed performance
  metrics that compare the performance of both designs in an in-house cluster
  deployed by using OpenStack. We focus on well-established representatives as
  baselines, including KVM from the hypervisor-based side, LXD from the
  container-based side in addition to Docker. Our results show that
  containerization is not a predominant fit-all solution that can always replace
  hypervisors for all cluster deployment and application scenarios. It can
  instead be thought of as a complementary solution to use for specific
  application scenarios that are constrained with conditions that are solved by
  containerization merits.
