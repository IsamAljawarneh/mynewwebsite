### Overview

1.	Introduction to Data Structures and Abstract Data Types (ADT).
2.	Analysis of algorithms and the big-O notation.
3.	Java Review: arrays, classes, interfaces, exceptions, static and dynamic data allocation, simple I/O, inheritance, polymorphism, casting and generics.
4.	Linear structures: Stacks, Queues, Priority queues, Lists, and Sequences (Array and linked).
5.	Non-Linear Structures: Trees and Graphs.
6.	Searching and sorting algorithms.

### Objectives
- [x] To explain the concepts of data structures and Abstract Data Types (ADT).
- [x] To Apply methods of algorithmâ€™s analysis to assess different algorithms used in various data structures.
- [x] To be able to implement Abstract Data Types (ADT) using JAVA.
- [x] To be able to describe the different methods of sorting and searching.
- [x] To be able to analyze algorithms used for searching and sorting.
- [x] To Write stack and queue applications using ADTs.
- [x] To be able to write efficient searching and sorting algorithms and compare them in terms of complexity and efficiency.
