abstract: The diversity of sensing options that IoT offers imposed requirements
  to evolve stream processing engines so to cope with highly heterogeneous and
  fast-pace data streams challenging their computing capacities. Location
  intelligence applications aim at exploiting those geo-referenced data in
  generating visualizations and dashboards that provide deep insights for
  assisting decision making in smart cities and urban planning. As data arriving
  are mostly geo-referenced and the rate is fluctuating in pace and skewness,
  computations upon streams should depend on approximation by applying methods
  such as sampling. Representativeness in sampling designs remains the pivotal
  concern in the literature. In spatial data streams contexts, it loosely means
  selecting proportional counts of spatial tuples from each group of tuples that
  belong to the same real geometry (i.e., geographically residing in the same
  proximity) within each streaming time window. This is challenging in streaming
  settings because spatial data is parametrized, loosing hence it is real
  geometries, which requires costly geometric operations to project them back to
  maps. To close this void, we have designed SpatialSPE in a previous work and
  incorporated an efficient fine-grained spatial online sampling method (SAOS)
  transparently within its layers. In this paper, we extend SAOS (the novel
  method is termed ex-SAOS) by new features that allow efficient online spatial
  sampling on a coarser level, which is a requirement in smart city scenarios.
  Our results show that ex-SAOS is efficient and effectively extends SAOS for
  more general smart city and urban computing scenarios.
