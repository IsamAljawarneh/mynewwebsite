### Overview

- Depending on the Internet as the main source of information regarding all aspects of our life is becoming a trend. 
  - People seek relevant information, suggestions, and recommendations in an overloaded online world and through social ties regarding their daily activities, including places to visit and restaurants to try new food. 
  - The wide variety of choices that are available online causes information overloading, which thereby complicates the selection process. 
- Traditional `recommender systems` are mostly dependent on a conventional model that is based on user-item-rating interaction without considering contextual information. 
- We claim that new generations of recommendation systems able to exploit context in an innovative and efficient way is important and may statistically yield more significant rating predictions. 
- However, only few research works have focused on how to effectively and efficiently exploit context metadata in Deep Learning (DL)-based recommendations. 
  - The main reason lies, perhaps most significantly, in the fact that most current DL algorithms are not intrinsically designed to incorporate contextual tags. 
In this project, we provide a significant contribution for filling this gap by designing a hybrid algorithm that retrofits and repurposes a pre-filtering contextual incorporation method and feeds the new dimension to a DL-based neural collaborative filtering method, thus preserving and recovering the benefits of both without their limitations. 
- Quantitative results show that our method outperforms the baselines by statistically significant margins.
