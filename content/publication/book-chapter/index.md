abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is leading to the deployment of
  an extensive number of smart devices capable of assisting companies and people
  in their daily activities. For this paradigm to be effective, these devices
  must exchange a huge amount of information and be coordinated in
  unpredictable, dynamic, and very complex scenarios. So far, cloud computing
  has centralized data storage and offered coordination of devices. However, as
  the number of deployed smart devices increases and the requirements of IoT
  solutions are more stringent, cloud computing hardly meets them. Fog computing
  has emerged as a middle layer between end-devices and cloud environments to
  support the requirements of IoT applications that cannot be met by the current
  edge-cloud model. A great effort has been devoted during the past few years to
  the development of this fog vision. Most of these solutions focused on
  improving specific characteristics, but not on supporting all the key
  requirements of an IoT solution. Thus, a deep investigation of these solutions
  to understand how they can be connected and coordinated to meet these
  necessities is essential. In this paper, we distinguish the most vital
  necessities that IoT solutions present to accomplish a right operation. Also,
  by analyzing the available solutions, we propose a novel global architectural
  model for fog computing meeting the recognized demands. We also provide a
  novel scientific taxonomy for breaking down the overviewed solutions. We
  conclude by analyzing the most essential recommendations in Fog computing for
  IoT, thereby distinguishing open issues and research frontiers that must be
  prioritized in order to have a totally developed fog computing environment,
  ready to meet the IoT solutions' prerequisites.
