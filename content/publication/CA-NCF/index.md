abstract: Depending on the Internet as the main source of information regarding
  all aspects of our life is becoming a trend. People seek relevant information,
  suggestions, and recommendations in an overloaded online world and through
  social ties regarding their daily activities, including places to visit and
  restaurants to try new food. The wide variety of choices that are available
  online causes information overloading, which thereby complicates the selection
  process. Traditional recommender systems are mostly dependent on a
  conventional model that is based on user-item-rating interaction without
  considering contextual information. We claim that new generations of
  recommendation systems able to exploit context in an innovative and efficient
  way is important and may statistically yield more significant rating
  predictions. However, only few research works have focused on how to
  effectively and efficiently exploit context metadata in Deep Learning
  (DL)-based recommendations. The main reason lies, perhaps most significantly,
  in the fact that most current DL algorithms are not intrinsically designed to
  incorporate contextual tags. In this paper, we provide a significant
  contribution for filling this gap by designing a hybrid algorithm that
  retrofits and repurposes a pre-filtering contextual incorporation method and
  feeds the new dimension to a DL-based neural collaborative filtering method,
  thus preserving and recovering the benefits of both without their limitations.
  The paper also reports quantitative results that show that our method
  outperforms the baselines by statistically significant margins.
