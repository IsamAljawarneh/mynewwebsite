#### Overview

- `SpatialSSJP` is a QoS-aware adaptive stream-static `join processor` that exploits a custom `geospatial online sampling` method for selecting proportionate sampling fraction through the application of an embedded rate controller and serve it to SAOS using a `feedback loop mechanism`. 
- SpatialSSJP is an `approximation` framework that is designed to efficiently tradeoff miniscule error-bounded accuracy for low-latency, thereby assisting SpatialDSMS to survive during brutal burst spikes in data arrival rates.
  - SpatialSSJP achieves that in a `circadian rhythm` without counteracting the benifits of its controller
