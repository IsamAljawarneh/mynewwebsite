### Overview
{{< hl >}} PhD degree level course{{< /hl >}}

I  am co-teaching this PhD course  **`in collaboration with Prof. Luca Foschini`** during 2022 at [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en). 

### Course Description
With most data arriving from real-world data-intensive problems being geo-referenced, it is becoming indispensable to design distributed geospatial software solutions for the large-scale management of such data. This course brings the foundational knowledge, explaining pivotal aspects pertinent to designing highly efficient distributed geospatial solutions for data-intensive applications. It covers the enabling technologies and architectures in Cloud storage and computing, including programing models (such as MapReduce and SQL-like declarative models) and algorithms from a middleware perspective.
