### Overview

- The problem of `information overloading` is prevalent in recommendations websites and `social networks`. 
- Users seek relevant recommendations from like-minded connections. User-item interactions (i.e., ratings) are prevalent in recommendation websites such as Netflix, whereas user-user connections are the interaction sought in social websites such as Twitter. 
- Social recommender systems seek to generate recommendations for users based on similar preferences of their close friends. 
- Because social networks do not normally contain user-item interactions, `social recommender systems` are typically hybridized with other recommenders (e.g., website recommenders such as Netflix) that provide such interaction. 
  - However, current systems are unaware of the userâ€™s additional `contextual information` when coupled with `social` counterparts. 
- US-NCF is a `context-aware deep learning-based recommender system`, in support for social recommender systems.
