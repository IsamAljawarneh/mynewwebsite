{{< hl >}}I have co-advised several undergraduate researchers within the last five years.{{< /hl >}}

## An example outstanding undergraduate student's project that I co-supervised recently:

{{< hl >}}project title{{< /hl >}}: *QoS-aware Cloud-based Meteo and Mobility Data Processing at Scale*

{{< hl >}}student{{< /hl >}}: [Denis Pereira](https://ie.linkedin.com/in/denis-pereira/en) currently `DevOps Engineer` at [workday Ireland](https://www.workday.com/en-us/homepage.html)

{{< hl >}}My Role{{< /hl >}}:  **`Co-Advisor`** with Prof. [Paolo Bellavista](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/paolo.bellavista/en)

{{< hl >}}Year{{< /hl >}}:  `2021`

{{< hl >}}Code{{< /hl >}}:  [Code](https://github.com/denper1/MeteoMobilityIntegration)

**Project Description**
Our student worked on a novel algorithm that enables the seamless integration of georeferenced mobility and meteorological data streams. The purpose is to generate a unified view that enables joint analytics. Advanced queries are then supported, such as `what are the Top-5 polluted neighborhoods in NYC, where vehicle mobility rates are high`. The project aims at enabling insightful analytics that foster the culture of planning the cities in a way that reduces the impact of air-borne pollutants (such as PM10 and PM2.5) on the health of the lightweight dwellers.

- At [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it), I had the honor to serve as a co-advisor for several undergraduate and graduate research projects (from 2017 through 2021) that are related to `NoSQL data warehousing` and `big data management`.
- Before 2016, At [University of Business and Technology](https://www.ubt.edu.sa/About/Home) (from 2013 to 2015), I supervised several undergraduate final year graduation projects in several CS areas.
