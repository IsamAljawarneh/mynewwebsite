abstract: In the last decade, novel software architectural patterns, such as
  microservices, have emerged to improve application modularity and to
  streamline their development, testing, scaling, and component replacement. To
  support these new trends, new practices as DevOps methodologies and tools,
  promoting better cooperation between software development and operations
  teams, have emerged to support automation and monitoring throughout the whole
  software construction lifecycle. That affected positively several IT
  companies, but also helped the transition to the softwarization of complex
  telco infrastructures in the last years. Container-based technologies played a
  crucial role by enabling microservice fast deployment and their scalability at
  low overhead; however, modern container-based applications may easily consist
  of hundreds of microservices services with complex interdependencies and call
  for advanced orchestration capabilities. While there are several emerging
  container orchestration engines, such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Apache
  Mesos, and Cattle, a thorough functional and performance assessment to help IT
  managers in the selection of the most appropriate orchestration solution is
  still missing. This paper aims to fill that gap. Collected experimental
  results show that Kubernetes outperforms its counterparts for very complex
  application deployments, while other engines can be a better choice for
  simpler deployments.
